title: "Passing Data"
description: "Using data from previous steps in the current one"
---

Data travels through the flow starting from the trigger until the last piece in the flow.

This allows flows to be so powerful as you can design each step to work with the flowing data.

There are two types of data that you can use in any step:

- Output from previous steps: `${step_name.output_variable}`
- Config variables: `${configs.variable_key}`

We'll go through both types in detail.

### Steps Output

Each step of your flow has an **input** that flows in and an **output** that flows out.

You can use the output of any previous step in the piece settings.

If you use just `${step_name}`, this variable will contain the full output from that step. If the output was a JSON object, you can access its properties like this: `${step_name.property_name}`.

Steps names show on the second line of any step, for example, the following step is called `step_2`. These names are generated automatically.

### Config Variables

Config variables let you store simple data and use across your collection flows. Variables have **keys** and **values**.

You can define Config Variables by clicking on **Configs** next to Test flow, then **+ New Variable**.

Any variable in the collection can be resued in any other step by using this syntax: `${configs.variable_key}`.

You will learn this practically in the second part of the example below.

### Example

We'll add 2 code pieces, the first one will return a JSON object, and the second one will use it.

**Using Steps Output**

1. Start a new flow.
2. Set the trigger to anything (we'll only run the flow through **Test flow**).
3. Add a code piece, add the following code to it:
```javascript
exports.codePiece = async (params) => {
    return {
        type: "alien",
        color: "beautiful",
        age: 1200
    };
};
```
4. Add another code piece, we want to pass the output of the previous code step to this one, and use it to construct a sentence.
5. In the **Parameters** section of the piece settings, we'll set the following parameters:

| Key | Value |
| - | - |
| type | `${step_1.type}` |
| color | `${step_1.color}` |
| age | `${step_1.age}` |

It will look like this:

**Using Config Variables**

5. Click on **Configs** next to Test flow. In the Configs Panel, click on **+ New Variable**. Define a new variable with they key `planet` and the value `Pluto` and save it.

6. Go back to the second code piece, add a 4th parameter with the key `planet` and the value `${configs.planet}`. This will pass the config variable to the code piece.

**Final Code and Testing**

6. We'll use the 4 parameters in the code by `params.key`. Use the following code for the second code piece:
```javascript
exports.codePiece = async (params) => {
    return "Welcome to "+ params.planet + ".\n\n"+
      "I am a "+ params.color +" "+ params.type +" and I am "+ params.age +" years old!";
};
```

7. Click on **Test flow** and watch the output of the second code piece. It will look like this:

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You are now capable of passing data through flow steps!
