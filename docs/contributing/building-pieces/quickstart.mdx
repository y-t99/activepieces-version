This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating an Hacker news piece with an action that fetches the top stores. It is assumed that you are familiar with the following:

* [Activepieces Repo Structure](../contributing/repo-structure) and familiar with [Activepieces Local development](../contributing/local-development)
* Typescript syntax

Hacker News is a social news website that allows users to submit and vote on stories related to computer science and entrepreneurship.

# Piece definition

To get started, let's create the piece definition and folder for Hackernews:

```bash
mkdir packages/pieces/apps/hackernews && cd packages/pieces/apps/hackernews
```

Next, let's create the definition file:

```bash
touch index.ts
```

Inside this file, paste the following code:

```ts
import { createPiece } from '../../framework/piece';

export const hackernews = createPiece({
  name: 'hackernews',
  displayName: 'Hackernews',
  logoUrl: 'https://cdn.activepieces.com/pieces/hackernews.png',
  actions: [],
  triggers: [],
});
```

# Action definition

Now let's create first action which fetch top stories from hackernews, The first step to do that is to create folder for the actions inside the hackernews folder.

```bash
mkdir actions
```

Next, Let's create the action file:

```bash
touch fetch-top-stories.ts
```

Inside this file, paste the following code:

<Tip>
You can ask ChatGPT3 to write the function to get top stories from hackernews.
</Tip>

```typescript
import {createAction} from '../../../framework/action/action';
import {HttpMethod} from '../../../common/http/core/http-method';
import {httpClient} from '../../../common/http/core/http-client';
import {Property} from "../../../framework/property/prop.model";

export const fetchTopStories = createAction({
	name: 'fetch_top_stories', // Must be a unique across the piece, this shouldn't be changed.
    displayName:'Fetch Top Stories',
    description: 'Fetch top stories from hackernews',
	props: {
        // Properties to ask from the user, in this ask we will take number of
		number_of_stories: Property.Number({
			displayName: 'Number of Stories',
			description: undefined,
			required: true,
		})
	},
	async run(configValue) {
        const HACKER_NEWS_API_URL = "https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/";
        const topStoryIdsResponse = await httpClient.sendRequest<string[]>({
			method: HttpMethod.GET,
			url: `${HACKER_NEWS_API_URL}topstories.json`
		});
        const topStoryIds: string[] = topStoryIdsResponse;
        const topStories = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(configValue.propsValue['number_of_stories']!, topStoryIds.length); i++) {
          const storyId = topStoryIds[i];
          const storyResponse = await httpClient.sendRequest({
            method: HttpMethod.GET,
            url: `${HACKER_NEWS_API_URL}item/${storyId}.json`
          });
          topStories.push(storyResponse);
        }
		return topStories;
	},
});

```

This code defines an `action` that fetches the top stories from Hacker News using API.

The createAction function takes an object with several properties, including the `name`, `displayName`, `description`, `props`, and `run` function of the action.

The `name` property is a unique identifier for the action. The `displayName` and `description` properties are used to provide a human-readable name and description for the action.

The `props` property is an object that defines the properties that the action requires from the user. In this case, the action requires a single property called `number_of_stories`, which is a number representing the number of stories to fetch.

The `run` function is the function that is called when the action is executed. It takes a single argument, configValue, which contains the values of the action's properties.

The `run` function first defines the URL of the Hacker News API, and then makes a GET request to the topstories.json endpoint using the httpClient.sendRequest function to fetch the top story IDs. It then iterates over the top story IDs and makes a GET request to the `item/{id}.json` endpoint for each story ID to fetch the details of each story. Finally, it returns the top stories as an array.

# Expose The definition

To make the action readable by Activepieces, add it to the array of actions in the piece definition.

```typescript
import { createPiece } from '../../framework/piece';
// Don't forget to add the following import.
import { fetchTopStories } from './actions/top-stories-in-hacker-news';

export const hackernews = createPiece({
  name: 'hackernews',
  displayName: 'Hackernews',
  logoUrl: 'https://cdn.activepieces.com/pieces/hackernews.png',
  // Add the action here.
  actions: [fetchTopStories], // <--------
  triggers: [],
});
```

To make the `hackernews` piece readable by Activepieces, add it to the pieces array in `/packages/pieces/apps/index.ts`.

First, import the `hackernews` piece at the top of the file by adding the following line:


``` ts
import { hackernews } from './hackernews'; // Import the hackernews piece

export const pieces: Piece[] = [
  // other pieces
  hackernews, // Add the hackernews piece to the array
  // more pieces
];

```

# Testing 

The backend and frontend are running using `nodemon`, which will automatically refresh the server when any changes are made to the source code.

To test the action, you can use the Flow Builder in Activepieces. It should be working as shown in the provided screenshot.
