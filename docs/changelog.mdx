Semantic versioning is a standardized way of versioning software projects. It uses a three-part version number in the format `X.Y.Z`, where:

X is the major version number, which is incremented for significant or breaking changes to the software.
Y is the minor version number, which is incremented for new features or functionality that is backwards-compatible with the previous version.
Z is the patch number, which is incremented for bug fixes and other small changes that do not add new features or break backwards compatibility.

Note: Please note that all small changes will be included in the changelog for minor version updates.
